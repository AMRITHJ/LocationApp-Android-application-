# LocationApp-Android-application-


To develop an Android application that allows users to enter location details (Latitude, Longitude), save the data in Firebase, and display the saved latitude and longitude immediately after saving. The application will also display all saved locations in a new activity and provide a search functionality to filter relevant locations based on latitude/longitude input. This experiment demonstrates the integration of cloud-based storage systems and search functionality in Android.MainActivity.java
